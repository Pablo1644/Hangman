# Hangman Game

This repository contains a simple Hangman game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.

## How to Play

- The game randomly selects a word from the `words.txt` file.
- Guess letters by typing them on your keyboard.
- Each incorrect guess will draw part of the hangman.
- You have 11 attempts to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully drawn.
- Used letters are shown on the screen. 
- Words are in polish
